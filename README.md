## Admission Prediction

In the ML Add-On course project to predict chances of addmission was assigned, I used linear regression to predict the percentage chance of securing admission. The project involved building a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of admission based on certain factors.

To make the model accessible to users, I converted it into a website using HTML, CSS, and Flask. This allowed users to input their information and receive a prediction regarding their chances of admission.

Overall, the project provided a practical application of linear regression in predicting admission probabilities and demonstrated the integration of machine learning models into web applications using Flask.
